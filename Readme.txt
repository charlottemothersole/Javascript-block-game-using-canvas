This is a basic javascript game using canvas elements and js to create a block that moves according to keyboard input across a defined field.

Original inspiration from a codebar live session hosted by Alice Lieutier (alicelieutier on github). Original files found here: https://github.com/alicelieutier/minimal-html-starter

Added own modifications:
- Colour customisation of block
- Add field obstacles for block to avoid

To do
- Add more obstacles
- further customisation, maybe different shapes??
